-- 1. [SKIPPED] Columns 'reason' and 'attachment_url' already exist.

-- 2. Create the 'medical_certificates' storage bucket (if it doesn't exist)
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('medical_certificates', 'medical_certificates', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- 3. RESET Policies (Drop first to avoid "already exists" errors)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated uploads" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access" ON storage.objects;

-- 4. Re-create Policy: Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'medical_certificates');

-- 5. Re-create Policy: Allow anyone to view
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'medical_certificates');
